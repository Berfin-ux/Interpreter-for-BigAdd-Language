# Interpreter for BigAdd Language
Programming Languages Lesson Project-2

Task: Write an interpreter for the BigAdd Language.

Input: Prompt for the source file name. Get the source file name from the user. Assuming the user 
gave the name x, you should open and read the source file with the extension “.ba” like x.ba.

Output:
The interpreter should run the program defined in the file if the code is correct.
The interprter should report the first error it encounters while loading the code. It should be able to 
detect any type of error that violates BigAdd syntax and semantics. The ability to catch the errors 
and reporting them in an informative way is a significant criterion in the evaluation of your work
